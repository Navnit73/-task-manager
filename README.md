# Task Manager

This is a simple task management tool built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, delete tasks, and filter tasks by their status. The application also supports local storage to persist tasks across page reloads.

## Features

- Add a new task
- Mark a task as completed
- Delete a task
- Filter tasks by status (All, Active, Completed)
- Persist tasks in local storage

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Navnit73/-task-manager.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd task-manager
```

3. Install the dependencies:
